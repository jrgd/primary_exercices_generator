# primary exercices generator
To support my daughter at school, we started to do extra homework.
These small programs generates exercices we are using to train in the evening.
She is currently year 3 in Quebec, and would be year 4 in UK.

You would use this from the command line, and copy-paste the output:
```bash
php ./rand_int_list.php
```
to work on french numbers, with which she still has some hesitations (she is a native english speaker)

or
```bash
php ./calculs.php
```
this one generates tables for calculations.


Happy homeworking!

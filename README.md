# primary_exercices_generator
To support my daughter at school, we started to do extra homework.
These small programs generates exercices we are using to train in the evening.

You would use them from the command line, and copy-paste the output:
```bash
php ./rand_int_list.php
```
to work on french numbers, with which she still has sonme hesitations (she is a native english speaker)

or
```bash
php ./calculs.php
```
this one generates tables for calculations
